- Plugins
	- Make use of ILocationFormatProvider
- Integrate GrapesJS for HTML Builder (wait for version with Bootstrap Blocks. See roadmap: https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/issues/74)
- Change Admin UI to some open source Bootstrap theme? Also, use Bootstrap 4
- Installation page
- Integrate Identity Server 4?
- Get rid of RolePermission, etc and use Identity Claims instead. Also, move UserProfile entity to somewhere in the framework.

NOTE: Plugins and Events had to be moved to Mantle.dll (from Mantle.Web.dll). Try to change this when have time (AutofacEngine should not rely on calling PluginManager, etc)


- Create a "GrapesJsPage" page type. There will likely need to be a button in place of the TinyMCE editor. The button will open a new tab to edit the HTML in Grapes JS
	- Once this is done and once plugins are working, then move the new page type and also the GrapesJsMessageTemplateEditor from "Mantle.Web.Messaging" into
		a new plugin.. something like: Mantle.Plugins.Editors.GrapesJs

- Move from Durandal to Aurelia for the backend. Example project has already been started here: https://github.com/gordon-matt/aurelia-razor-netcore2-skeleton
