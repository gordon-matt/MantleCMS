- Plugins
	- Make use of ILocationFormatProvider
- Integrate GrapesJS for HTML Builder (wait for version with Bootstrap Blocks. See roadmap: https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/issues/74)
- Change Admin UI to some open source Bootstrap theme? Also, use Bootstrap 4
- Installation page
- Integrate Identity Server 4?
- Get rid of RolePermission, etc and use Identity Claims instead. Also, move UserProfile entity to somewhere in the framework.

- Create a "GrapesJsPage" page type. There will likely need to be a button in place of the TinyMCE editor. The button will open a new tab to edit the HTML in Grapes JS
	- Once this is done and once plugins are working, then move the new page type and also the GrapesJsMessageTemplateEditor from "Mantle.Web.Messaging" into
		a new plugin.. something like: Mantle.Plugins.Editors.GrapesJs

- Move from Durandal to Aurelia for the backend. Example project has already been started here: https://github.com/gordon-matt/aurelia-razor-netcore2-skeleton
	UPDATE: IN PROOGRESS

- BIG PROBLEM: Can't seem to be able to set "Copy to Output" for referenced libs like in older .NET Framework. So this causes bugs when trying to load plugins with dependencies that
	are not referenced by the main app. Example: "Mantle.Plugins.Caching.Redis" references a NuGet package called "StackExchange.Redis" and this is nto copied to the output directory.
	Asked question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50276292/how-do-i-copy-only-specific-packages-to-the-output-directory-in-net-core-2-0

BUG: Pages with aurelia-tinymce-wrapper will, for some unknown reason, break the nav menu.. perhaps just use tinymce without the aurelia wrapper?
