- Plugins
	- Make use of ILocationFormatProvider
- Integrate GrapesJS for HTML Builder (wait for version with Bootstrap Blocks. See roadmap: https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/issues/74)
- Change Admin UI to some open source Bootstrap theme? Also, use Bootstrap 4
- Installation page
- Integrate Identity Server 4?
- Get rid of RolePermission, etc and use Identity Claims instead. Also, move UserProfile entity to somewhere in the framework.

- Create a "GrapesJsPage" page type. There will likely need to be a button in place of the TinyMCE editor. The button will open a new tab to edit the HTML in Grapes JS
	- Once this is done and once plugins are working, then move the new page type and also the GrapesJsMessageTemplateEditor from "Mantle.Web.Messaging" into
		a new plugin.. something like: Mantle.Plugins.Editors.GrapesJs

- BIG PROBLEM: Can't seem to be able to set "Copy to Output" for referenced libs like in older .NET Framework. So this causes bugs when trying to load plugins with dependencies that
	are not referenced by the main app. Example: "Mantle.Plugins.Caching.Redis" references a NuGet package called "StackExchange.Redis" and this is nto copied to the output directory.
	Asked question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50276292/how-do-i-copy-only-specific-packages-to-the-output-directory-in-net-core-2-0
	UPDATE: had an idea: might be best to write a script/.bat file to check for all DLLs from main MantleCMS project and then delete any from the plugins folder that match
		that list (duplicates).
	ANOTHER IDEA: Instead of referencing plugins in the old fashion, how about packaging them as NuGet files and adding them to the app dynamically (at runtime) from plugins folder?

Why does URL have a 0 when editing localizable strings? refresh breaks it as well.

Implement page for log..

Small bug in Regions when on cities page and click "Back" button - it shows blank instead of grid..

Make file manager as an interface, so it can be swapped out (RFM as default, but can be elFinder or other...)
